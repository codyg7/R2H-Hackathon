                    <p>We know how important SAT is for college admissions ,and a “good” score might not make the cut
                        anymore.
                        You need a better, higher score. Also gaining acess to a test prep program is really expensive.
                        Thats
                        why Revive's SAT Prep packages can help you score big without worrying abou the cost. We know

                        SAT
                        diagnostic test, taken under the same conditions a student experiences on a real SAT test date.
                        With the
                        results, our SAT tutors create a tailored program designed to pinpoint the student’s individual
                        strengths and weaknesses. Our small group sizes allow for individual attention, making sure each
                        student
                        receives the support and instruction needed for SAT success. We will also help each student
                        acheive
                        scholarships to colleges and require that the student stay in college at least on year. We will
                        guide
                        students through thier first year and provide with 1:1 counseling every month to help them
                        excel.
